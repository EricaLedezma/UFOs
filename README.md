## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create an interactive website of UFO data. The website will allow users to filter to out to multiple criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

The user can pick one or multiple criteria points and data meeting that criteria will populate on the table on the page. 

For example, if you put AZ in the state box, all the data has AZ listes at the state will populate in the table to the right.

Or if you wanted to search the data pertainint to AZ and sightings in the shape of a triangle, then you would enter AZ in the state and then type in triangle in the shape box. All the data meeting those two criteria will populate in the table to the right.

## Summary
One drawback is this interactive webpage just provides data and doesn't really tell the user much more. To further enhance this webpage, there should be some type of legend added with visuals. For example, what do the different shapes look like. 

You could even do a different analysis on trends for UFO sightings based on the locations or shape.
